# Workflow CA

This is my course assignment for the Workflow course at Noroff.<br>
Fall 2024

## Description

"Using the skills and knowledge from this course, improve the quality of a package by establishing helpful workflows that make the development process more efficient."<br>
<br>
Project files are forked from Noroff at (https://github.com/NoroffFEU/social-media-client) and the following process was completed:<br>

- "Create a new branch called workflow."
- "Configure the project with eslint, prettier and commit hooks."
- "Configure the project with GitHub Actions for build/deploy if required."
- "Record any bugs found during this process in the Issues tab."
- "Configure the project for Jest and Cypress."
- "Create tests to cover the required test cases." These being tests for login and logout with jest, and valid/invalid login plus logout tests with cypress.
- "Create a Pull Request from workflow into the default branch."
- "Request a review from your peers to help improve your submission."
- "Make any final changes based on this feedback."
- "Submit a link to the Open Pull Request on Moodle."
